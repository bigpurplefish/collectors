# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Python Development Standards

### Always Apply
- Use context7 for up-to-date library documentation
- Reference @~/Code/shared-docs/python/ for our internal standards
- Combine external best practices with our internal requirements

### Before Any Code Generation
1. Check Context7 for latest library patterns (use context7)
2. Review our internal requirements @~/Code/shared-docs/python/
3. Ensure both external and internal standards are met
